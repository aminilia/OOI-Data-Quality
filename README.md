The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) is funded by National Science Foundation and includes six observation arrays. In this report, the CTD (specifically temperature and salinity) from the Pioneer Offshore Profiler Mooring (CP04OSPM), focusing on the 2015 year (Deployment 2, 3, and 4), were analyzed to assess quality of observed data.
